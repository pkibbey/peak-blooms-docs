I've analyzed the "Peak Blooms" build site alongside your refined narrative in Canvas. To ensure the live project fully supports your identity as a **Full-Stack Architect** who evolves legacy wisdom into AI-integrated workflows, I have some strategic recommendations for the site's content and presentation.

Since you are targeting roles where you lead within teams, the site should act as a "Technical Case Study" rather than just a portfolio piece.

### 1. The "Architectural Manifesto" (Header/Hero)

Currently, the site might feel like a standard app. To align with the resume, the hero section should explicitly state the **Strategic Objective** mentioned in your resume.

* **Suggestion:** Add a small "Architect’s Note" or a prominent sub-header: *"A 30-day architectural sprint evaluating the integration of React 19 Server Components with AI-driven development workflows."*
* **Why:** This immediately frames the site as a deliberate experiment in velocity and stability, rather than just a hobby project.

### 2. Visibility of the "AI Workflow"

Your resume highlights a 300% increase in velocity. The website should "show the work" behind that claim.

* **Suggestion:** Create a "Dev Notes" or "Workflow" page (or a modal). Briefly describe how you used Claude/Ollama to accelerate the build.
* **Content:** Mention how AI was used for boilerplate generation, unit testing, or refactoring logic, while you (the Architect) provided the "Operational Judgment" to keep the system stable.

### 3. Deep Dive into React 19 & SSR/ISR

Since you've highlighted **React 19 Server Components** and **SSR & ISR Optimization** in Canvas, the site should demonstrate these technically.

* **Suggestion:** Include a small "System Health" or "Technical Specs" section in the footer or a dedicated page.
* **Details:** Show off the performance metrics (Lighthouse scores) or a brief diagram/text explaining the data flow between Server Actions and the persistence layer. This proves the "Hands-on Excellence" you claim in your Summary.

### 4. Design System Documentation

You mention partnering with UX and building Design Systems at Level Home and LivePerson.

* **Suggestion:** If "Peak Blooms" uses a custom component library or a strict Tailwind-based system, call it out. Even a link to a simple `/design-system` route that displays your primary UI components (buttons, cards, typography) would reinforce your commitment to "Design Consistency."

### 5. The "Sabbatical" Connection

Your resume mentions the Strategic Sabbatical as the source of this project's insight.

* **Key insights from the sabbatical:**
  - Use AI to bootstrap repetitive work (boilerplate, tests, mock data) but keep human review and architectural judgment as the final gate.
  - Design for observability and validation: invest in CI, test harnesses, and performance checks to verify AI-suggested changes quickly.
  - Centralize LLM orchestration server-side (Server Functions / Server Components) to simplify context, security, and latency management.
  - Prefer schema-first, type-safe models so AI-generated data and tests surface contract issues early, not at runtime.
  - Isolate model experiments in reproducible MCP environments so AI-assisted work remains auditable and repeatable.

* **Suggestion:** In an "About" or "Reflections" section, link the project back to that year of research.
* **Narrative:** *"After 15 years in enterprise architecture, I took a sabbatical to explore how Generative AI could industrialize the development cycle. Peak Blooms is the first production result of that research."*

### 6. Code Transparency (GitHub)

Ensure the README in your linked GitHub repository mirrors the language in Canvas.

* **Suggestion:** Update the repository description to: *"Full-Stack Architect Sprint: Evaluating React 19 and AI-integrated workflows for high-velocity system delivery."*

These changes transform the website from a standalone application into a living proof-of-concept for the specific career narrative you've built in Canvas. Would you like me to help draft the specific text for any of these site sections?
